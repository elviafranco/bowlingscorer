# bowlingscorer
As a bowler, I want to be able to enter a list of bowling frame scores so that I can see the progress and total score of my game.

## Overview
Comic Bowling Scorer is a web application which allows users to input bowling frame scores and recieve the score total. The logic for calculating the bowling score has been accessed using an Application Programming Interface (API). 

## Acceptance Criteria
* I will have a place to enter a series of scores per frame.
* A strike (all 10 pins knocked down in the first shot of a frame) earns 10 points plus the sum of the next two shots.
* A spare (all 10 pins knocked down using both shots of a frame) earns 10 points plus the sum of the next one shot.
* An incomplete game is scored up to the last frame provided.
